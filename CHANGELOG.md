# Changelog

[简体中文](CHANGELOG.zh-CN.md)

Published release notes are retained below; new versions are added without removing earlier entries.

## 0.1.17 — 2026-08-28

- Fixed the npm publish workflow to use the correct package scope (`@ggtec528`) and Trusted Publisher OIDC configuration.

Published package: [`@ggtec528/dsh-archive-manager@0.1.17`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ggtec528/dsh-archive-manager/v/0.1.17).

## 0.1.16 — 2026-08-27

- Added a restore icon to archived-group bulk action menus for consistent action affordances.

Published package: [`@michengai/dsh-archive-manager@0.1.16`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@michengai/dsh-archive-manager/v/0.1.16).

## 0.1.15 — 2026-08-26

- Hardened permanent deletion so missing transcripts clear stale archive, workspace, spill, and projection-cache data while failed physical deletion remains retryable.
- Cleared workspace and projection-cache tombstones when a session ID is reused, preventing valid replacement sessions from being blocked.
- Corrected batch deletion feedback and duplicate restore submission handling, and aligned client batch counts with the host's authoritative archive set.

## 0.1.14 — 2026-08-24

- Added confirmation, success, and partial-failure feedback for batch archive operations.
